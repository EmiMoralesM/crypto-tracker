# 🚀 Crypto Tracker - Personal Project

Crypto Tracker is a personal project that I created to showcase my skills in web development. As a cryptocurrency enthusiast, I wanted to build a web application that allows users to easily track the prices of their favorite cryptocurrencies in real-time.

## 🔥 Features
Crypto Tracker comes with a range of features that demonstrate my technical abilities:

- **React:** 💻 The user interface was built using the React JavaScript library, demonstrating my proficiency in **building complex web applications with reusable components**.

- **Chart.js:** 📈 The charts that display historical data were built using the Chart.js library, demonstrating my ability to **integrate third-party libraries** into my projects.

- **CoinGecko API:** 💰 Real-time price data is sourced from the CoinGecko API, demonstrating my ability to work with APIs to **fetch and display real-time data**.

- **Responsive design:** 📱 Crypto Tracker is designed to work on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices, demonstrating my ability to **build responsive web applications** that work across different screen sizes.

- **User authentication:** 🔒 Crypto Tracker also allows users to create accounts and save their watchlists and settings. Users can log in to Crypto Tracker from any device and access their watchlists and settings. This feature was implemented using Firebase.
